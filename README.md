# CNCF Projects App

## Overview
Have you ever wondered what an application architecture would look like if you committed to using mostly all graduated or incubating projects from the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/projects/)? This repo, the **[CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/) Projects App**, attempts to answer that question with an example expense application that is made up almost exclusively of CNCF projects. 

## CNCF Projects Application 
The CNCF Projects App is a sample expense application simulating a user submitting an expense report. The application consists of the following components:

* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) - Container Orchestration Cluster (CNCF)
* [Rook](https://rook.io/) - Storage Management (CNCF)
* [Harbor](https://goharbor.io/) - Container Registry (CNCF)
* [NATS](https://nats.io/) - Pub/Sub Messaging (CNCF)
* [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io/) - Service Mesh (CNCF)
* [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) - Monitoring (CNCF)
* [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) - Observability/Tracing (CNCF)
* [OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com/) - Functions
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) - Database
* [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) - Kubernetes Ingress Controller
* [Tekton](https://tekton.dev/) CI/CD (CD Foundation)
* [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) - Dashboard
* [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) - Email Service
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - Code Repository
* Web Front-End & Web API - [.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/about)

**TODO** : Need screenshots of app of various screens.
